# RSS-Feed-Aggregator-API
This project is a RESTful API built with Go, allowing users to manage and track RSS feeds, designed for personal content aggregation like blogs, news sites, and podcasts. Users can add their favorite RSS feeds, follow feeds added by others, and receive the latest updates from their followed feeds in real-time.
